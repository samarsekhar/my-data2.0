// There are three types of errors in programming : (a)Syntax Errors, (b)Runtime Errors, (c)Logical Errors.
// Syntax Errors:- Syntax errors also called parsing errors, occur at compile time in traditional programming languages and at interpret time in JS.
// Runtime Errors:- Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/ interpretation).
// Logical Errors:- Logic errors can be the most difficult type of errors to track down. These errors are the result of a suytax or runtime error.
