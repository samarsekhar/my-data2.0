Javascript is an Odject Oriented Programming(OOP) language. A programming language can be called object-orientend if it provides four basic capabilities to developers:-
* Encapsulation - the capability to store related information, whether data or methods together in an object.
* Aggregation - the capability to store one object inside another object.
* Inheritance - the capability of a class to rely upon another class(or number of classes) for some of its properties and methods.
* Polymorphism - the capability to write one function or method that works in a variety of different ways.

Object are composed of attributes. If an attribute contains a function, it is considered to be a method of the object, otherwise the attribute is considered a property.

`Object Properties`
Object properties can be any of the three primitive data types, or any of the abstract data types, such as another object.
Object properties are usually variables that are used internally in the object's methods, but can also be globally visible variables that are used througth the page.

The syntax for adding a property to an object is -
objectName.objectProperty = proprtyValue;

Example - Gets the document title using the 'title' property of the document object.
        var str = document.title;

`Object Methods`
Methods are the functions that let the do something or let something be done to it.
There is a small difference between a function and a method - at a function is a standalone unit of statements and a method is attched to an object and be referenced by "this" keyword.

Methods are useful for everything from displaying the contents of the object to the screen to performing complex mathematical operations on a group of local properties and parameters.

Example - To use the write() method of document object to write any content on the document.
        document.write("This is test");

`User-Defined Objects`
All user-defined objects and built-in objects are descendants of an object called Object.

The 'new' Operator
The 'new' operator is used to create an instance of N Object. To create an object, the new operator is followed by the constructor method.
the constructor methods are Object(), Array(), and Date(). These constructors are built-in JS functios.

var employee = new Object();
var books = new Array("JavaScript", "Python", "JAVA");
var day = new Date("August 15, 1947");

`The Object() Constructor`
A constructor is a function that creates and initializes an object. JS provides a special constructor function called Object() to build the object.
The return value of the Object() constructor is assigned to a variable.

The variable contains a reference to the new object. The properties assigned to the object are not variables and are not defined with the 'var' keyword.
