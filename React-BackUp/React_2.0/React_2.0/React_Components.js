/*  React Components 

 --> React organized groups of elements into React Component.
 --> A Basic function component is written similarly to a regular JavaScript function with a couple of differences.
     1. Component names must start with a capital letter (that is MyComponent, instead of myComponent )
     2. Components, unlike JavaScript functions, must return JSX.

    Here is the basic syntax of a React function component.

import React from 'react'

function ReactComponents() {
  return (
    <div>
      Hello World!............
    </div>
  )
}

export default ReactComponents;
