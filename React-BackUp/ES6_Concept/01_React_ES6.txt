React ES6
---------

-> ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
-> ECMAScript was Created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript.
-> React uses ES6:-
   1-Classes, 2-Arrow Functions, 3-Variables(let, const, var), 4-Array Methods like .map() , 5-Destructuring, 6-Modules, 7-Ternary Operator, 8-Spread Operator 

   Classes:-
   - A class is a type of function.
   - But Instead of using the keyword 'function' to initiate it.
   - The properties are assigned inside a constructor() method. The Constructor function is called automatically when object is initialized.
   - Class inheritance use the extends keyword. A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class.
   - The super() method refers to the parent class.
   - Calling the super() method in the constructor method, call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods.

   Arrow Functions:-
   - Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax.
